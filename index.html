  <p>
    This animation is accomplished by creating a @keyframs rule that the string
    value of selected element(s) (.character/span) gradually change from the
    current style to the new style at defined steps and time frame. No
    Javascript or Flash is used
  </p>

  <p>Animation properties used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>animation name: "flow"</li>
    <li>animation duration: 5 seconds</li>
    <li>transition-timing-fucntion: ease-in-out</li>
    <li>animation-iteration-count: infinite</li>
    <li>animation-delay*</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    *Animation-delay is applied to each character (.character/span). Delay
    propert is set to 0.5 seconds. nth-child() selecter is used to pick these
    characters individually
  </p>
  <p>
    *Note that the display value has to be "inline-block, where the top and
    bottoms margins/paddings are respected. Inline-block does not add a
    line-break after each element so each character get to be sitting next to
    each other"
